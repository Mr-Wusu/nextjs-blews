#Description
This is an application for getting dresses and fashion you desire tailored inch-perfect for you

#Steps
-Build the homepage first for mobile ✔️
-Work on authentication and authorisation, including but not limited to signin and signout pages ✔️(Later include intercepting routes for signin logic) ✔️
-Replace dummy data with database (crud operations) ✔️
-Make project responsive ✔️
-Grow the app with other pages and features, features like:

1.  sending messages to:
    - admin when crud operations are carried out
    - users when their orders are closed. (signifying service has been rendered).
    - users, after service has been rendered for review and possibly to give blews good rating.
2.  creating a cart and conditionally adding content there based on certain interactions on UI.
3. add platform for users' to submit fashion designs, have admin vet these dresses and at some point display ui.
